                <p>You can cancel seats (access codes) at any time before or during a scheduled event by using the ReadyTech Admin Portal. 
                    Below are detailed cancellation policies for each event type.</p>
                <p>Watch the video below or continue reading to learn about our cancellation policies.</p>

                <h2>Cancelling Instructor-Led events</h2>
                    <p>Includes the following event types:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Instructor-Led</li>
                        <li>Instructor Prep</li>
                        <li>ILT Flex</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Cancel un-activated access codes by 12:00 pm, on the first day of training to avoid charges for unused seats. 
                        The 12:00 pm cancellation time is based on the timezone of the event. Cancellations made after this time take 
                        effect the next day.</p>
                    <p>For example:</p>
                    <p>You have an event set to Pacific time zone (PST), and you request to cancel an access code at 1:00 pm (PST) on 
                        the first day of training. The access code is charged for the first day of training, but not for future days.</p>
                    <p>Note that ILT Flex events cannot be cancelled after 12:00 pm first day of training.</p>
                    
                    <div class="warning">
                        <div>An access code is charged regardless for days session data exists. See <a href="../events/sessions.htm">sessions</a> for more information.</div>
                    </div>
        
                <h2>Cancelling Self-Paced and Workshop events</h2>
                    <p>Includes the following event types:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Self-Paced</li>
                        <li>Workshop</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Cancel Self-Paced and Workshop events before they start to prevent charges. You cannot cancel Self-Paced events for which vouchers exist.</p>
                        
                    <div class="warning">
                        <div>You cannot cancel Self-Paced events that have started.</div>
                    </div>
